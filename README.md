## Our Motivation

### Our Vision - (a snippet of it's core message)

"The best financial system you can imagine. And as a by-product of that, the best of communities with support for the poor, the hungry, the sick and needy, uplifting the less-priviledged, supporting orphans and refugees especially kids and women.
We dream to sponsor research & development in medical fields that could potentially cure serious diseases prominent in minority groups globally like the "Sickle Cell" and other serious genetic disorders especially those prominent in kids and communities in under-developed regions of the world like regions in Africa (where I was born & raised).
This is my dream and Setheum will bear it through the "Setheum Foundation's Setheum Charity Fund" which receives a certain portiuon of network fees and SettMint fees and a designated allocation from the SIF (Setheum Investment Fund) including an Initial allocation from the Initial token allocation. And the Setheum Team vow to allocate a portion of our "Token Sale" raise to the "Setheum Charity Fund" which I run under the "Setheum Foundation" to support humanity as a cause because Setheum is indeed purpose driven. And indeed making the people rich is a side-effect of the good work."

### Our Mission - (a snippet of it's core message)

"SettPay serves the global community. It doesn't just serve it's initially intended purpose. We needed to invent SettPay, and to do that efficiently and innovatively we needed to invent Setheum. And now we realise the entire world needs SettPay and Setheum is there just and only to serve that purpose. Only to serve "SettPay", the halal market,  and the "Setheum Charity Fund", that's it! Getting rich from it is just a real side-effect, so beware"

### Mint your own native Zero-Interest stablecoins - "SettMint": (Just Unique to SettPay & Setheum) 

Users of SettPay can mint their own native currencies like the Naira or the Yen or the Riyal amongst tens of SettCurrencies on SettPay. Users can also propose to add currencies they like and want to trade or spend. 

SettMint lets users "reserve"/"lock" the SETT stablecoin (like the gold-standard) to mint it's equivalent of a SettCurrency of their choice amongst a variety of currencies. 

No interest is involved and it's fully shari'ah compliant (meaning no hidden fees or interest or any forms of usury). Just a 2% minting fee, and a 1% burning fee.

Just "reserve" SETT, mint your SettCurrency, and you're good to go. When you need to unreserve, just do so by burning the SettCurrency. No debt-like risk or massive volatility involved.. Just a few clicks, so easy.

With this you can spend you country's native cryptocurrency independent of the banks and documentations. Pay online and spend on e-commerce platforms, participate in trading on DeFi and Crypto Exchanges.

Store your assets on the blockchain not on the app. Be in custody of your assets and benefit directly from the inflation of the currencies you spend as you spend them (remember the cashdrops - YES this is where it comes from)
